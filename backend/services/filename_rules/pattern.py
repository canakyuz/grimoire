"""The folder naming pattern: one string that reads a filename and writes one.

A pattern is literal text with ``{field}`` placeholders, for example::

    {system} - [{publisher}] - {*} - {title}< (v{version}, {year})>

The same string works in both directions, which is the point of having one
mechanism rather than two (issues #521 and #522):

* **Reading** matches a filename stem against it and pulls out the fields, so a
  library named ``D&D5e - [Loot Tavern] - adventure - Crystallica (v0.99,
  2026).pdf`` shows as *Crystallica*, published by *Loot Tavern*.
* **Writing** fills the placeholders from a book's metadata to produce the
  filename the pattern describes, so a library can be renamed onto a scheme, or
  from one scheme onto the next.

``{*}`` matches anything and keeps nothing. It is what lets a pattern name only
the part it cares about without accounting for every other piece of a filename
- but a wildcard has no value to write back, so a pattern holding one can read
filenames and never rename them.

``<...>`` marks an optional part. Reading accepts the filename with or without
it; writing drops it when any field inside it is empty, so a book with no
version is written ``Title`` rather than ``Title (v, )``. The angle brackets are
free to use for this because no filesystem Grimoire runs on lets a filename
contain them portably - Windows forbids both outright.

Reading means the same as matching the pattern as one regex, anchored at both
ends and ignoring case, in which most fields are a lazy ``.+?`` and an optional
part is a greedy ``(?:...)?``. It is not done with that regex, though: every
lazy field multiplies the ways a backtracking engine tries to split a name that
does not fit, so a few ``{*}`` against one long name could take minutes, in a
scan or a preview. :class:`_Matcher` searches the same choices in the same
order, so it finds the same match, but remembers every (part, position) it has
already seen fail, which keeps the work to a few passes over the name.
